# Introduction
This book is written for the dungeon master. It contains a complete Dungeons & Dragons adventure, as well as descriptions for every creature and item that appears in the aventure. It is designed to introduce players to the world of the Half-Continent. Humorous Journey is designed for intermediate D&D players who have experience playing the game. Combat is difficult and bad moves often have repercussions. 
### The Homebrew
This adventure consists of a large amount of new content and rule differences. These main differences are: 
1. Magic has been removed, replaced with several classes that have unique abilities. 
2. Characters may only be human, but have a choice of many different locations to hail from. 
3. By virtue of how new skills are acquired, downtime is often required for adventurers seeking major skills. 

> These homebrews are designed to remain loyal to the Half-Continent setting. If you wish to alter the parameters though, why not? Make the Half-Continent your own.

This game is designed to be run on the Gritty Realism ruleset described in on DMG 267. Later portions of this book will describe how to balance this difficulty to offer engaging combat that does not feel unfair.

## The Half-Continent
This adventure is set in the Half-Continent, an overwide peninsula that runs west to east. It is a vast, mostly wild land where large cities rise along rivers and roads. Humanity struggles to push into the wilds of the world because of Monsters - non-animal creatures that wander the wilds, attacking everypersons who they encounter along the road. 

Because of this everpresent danger, daring adventurers called teratologists (monster hunters) are some of the most respected, and most well-paid members of society. While most folk rarely leave the cities and towns, adventurers in the H-C venture into wild lands in search of glory and fortune. 

The Empire on the Half-Continent resembles the lands of the Europe in the 1500s and 1600s, with some industrial age elements. The Empire, with its capitol Clementine in lands far north of this adventure's setting, exercises control over a large collection of mostly self-governing city states. The states, like Boschenberg and Brandenbrass, are in constant competition with one another, and can pay adventurers good money to hunt monsters, or harry their rivals. 

Along the river and seaways, large ironclad ships called rams and cromsters prowl the water, formidable ships constituting the H-C's extremely powerful navies. In the cities, fashionable peers discuss the finer points of society in fancy salons. In the countryside, soldiers, lamplighters, post officers, and wayfarers wander dangerous roads between wayhouses and manses, keenly aware of the dangers that lurk just off the road. 

The Corser at the Gate attempts to introduce the players to the settings of the H-C by staging their journey through several places on the Half-Continent. 

1. The story begins aboard a ram on the Vinegar Seas, and introduces naval combat and naval characters.

2. The second part of the story sees characters land in the Brindleshaws, a wild and dangerous marsh. 

3. The third part of the story takes place on a river barge and has the characters moving through the massive rivergates and navigating the waters. 

4. The finale of the story takes place in the large city-state capital of Boschenberg and introduces the cities of the Half-Continent. 

### The Vinegar Seas
Great opportunity and money awaits any who make the decision to enlist with an ocean-going vessel. The seas are, however, very dangerous. Ocean monsters called nadderers are a constant threat to sailors, as are pirates and enemy navies. Additionally, the very water of the vinegar seas is so caustic that it causes damage to the skin. 

Combat and life on the Vinegar Seas depends on a character's role on a ship. A ship's **captain** or **commander** coordinates an entire ship's crew, or even a flotilla, and combat revolves around large-scale maneuvering aboard the ship. A **passenger** or **vinegaroon** (seaperson) may have to operate cannons, make saving throws against enemy maneuvers, or engage in combat with enemy sailors or monsters. 

More information on running naval encounters can be found in later chapters. 

### The Wilds

The wilds are dangerous, thick, territories that inspire fear in even the most intrepid of adventurers. Some wilds are more frightful and dangerous than others - the Brindleshaws in this adventure are mild when compared with the unmitigated terror of the Ichormeer. 

Wilds are usually dense forest or marshland covered in a vague sense of watchfulness that builds into terror, a force called Threwd. The section of this adventure dedicated to the Brindleshaws will discuss how to account for threwd's effects throughout the adventure. 

\page

The wilds are also filled with monsters. People without sufficient protection or without the appropriate guardians are often killed by monsters along the roads of the wilds. Only a daring few, usually skilled in evasion and diversion, will wander the wilds without a strong accompaniment. 


### The Rivers

Rivers are important thoroughfares in the Half-Continent, as most of the large cities in the world are either built on the coast or on a riverine trade route. Ships called barges litter the rivers of the world, transporting goods up and down the waterways.

The rivers are, however, governed by gargantuan strutures called rivergates, which help the cities enforce tariffs and laws. Barges stopping at the rivergates are required to undergo a cargo inspection, and pay taxes on their goods. 

One consquence of the rivergates is that people engaged in the dark trades are forced to find labyrinthine ways to avoid the gates. Characters may encounter these unsavory people, or have some  goods of their own that they need to transport without being caught by revenue officers.

### The Cities

Most folk of the H-C live in the cities that dot the landscape. The largest of these are capitals for powerful states within the empire. The smaller are either controlled by, or seeking to rival, their powerful neighbors.

All manner of people live in the cities, from workers to administrators, cratspeople, servants, peers, and soldiers. Pubs, crafting halls, guildhouses, and salons can be found across the cities offering lively conversation and intriguing gossip. 

Characters must still be wary in cities, however; the proliferation of dark tradespeople within the city bounds is only increasing, and the odds of a lone person crossing paths with an unsavory character are high. 

### The Flavor of the World

Taken together, the Half-Continent is a dark, dangerous and foreboding place for many. Making money in the world almost always involves finding a dangerous line of employment. However,  characters can choose from a broad array of skills and classes powerful enough to brave a difficult world. 

## Custom Classes
Classes (for immersion you may wish to call them "professions" or "trades") allow characters to explore an interesting array of different skills and trades. However, the Half-Continent is a strange place, and often the skills require training, surgery, or a combination of the two. Long periods of downtime can be used to help facilitate these larger changes without requiring players to spend too much time worrying about the changes. 

Classes are divided broadly into several groups, and some have close analogues to traditional fifth edition classes. The largest differences lie in the removal of magic classes and their replacement with groups like the combat chemists and the lahzars (see below). 

### Martial Classes
Pediteers are martial soldiers, relying on strength of arm to overcome enemies. They employ cudgels, clubs, and firelock weaponry (see item appendix) in battle. Some may have combat potives that they use as well. 

In the H-C, almost every monster has an innate resistance to slashing and piercing damage. Additionally, a special chemically-coated armor called proofing renders many soldiers particularly resistant to these damage types as well. As such, bludgeoning damage weapons are usually used. Firelocks, like muskets and flintlocks, will inflict blugeoning damage on a proofed soldier.

Pediteers and Pistoleers are much like rangers, rogues, and fighters. 

#### Subclasses
- Pistoleers 
- Musketeers
- Stick-Fighters

### Skolds

Characters may choose to become a skold, a sort of combat chemist who uses special brews called "potives" in battle. Some skolds, called Dispensurists, brew healing drafts. Others brew powerful chemicals designed to damage and kill opponents. Still others try to distract and dismay enemies with tricky potives that confound the senses. 

Skolds, broadly, replace the magical classes in this world. They may prepare a series of potives each day for use in the day's activities. These potives can be extremely powerful and can cause wide devastation on their enemies. 

Skolds are most similar to wizards. Dispensurists can be thought of as similar to clerics. An untrained skold, known as a ledgermaine, is most similar to a wild-magic warlock - dangerous, but with unpredictable results.

#### Subclasses
- Scourges (pure combat skolds)
- Dispensurists
- Ledgermaines
- Rhubezhals (like paladins) 

### Lahzars

Lahzars are the strangest new classes introduced by this world. Individuals may elect to undergo surgeries in far away lands that give them power to manipulate electricity - at a cost. Use of lahzar abilities (called potencies) can be devastating in battle, but are hard on the individual body. 

Lahzars are not always accepted in the lands of the Empire. Treated as strange individuals, their efficacy as monster-hunters earns them a place at the table, if grudgingly. 

#### Wits

Wits are lahzars with organs surgically introduced to their body in their head. They manipulate electric signals within people to detect nearby individuals, inflict psychic pain, and even mislead or misdirect foes.

\page

#### Fulgars
Fulgars are lahzaras with organs in their upper-torso that let them manipulate electrical fields within their own bodies and disperse the energy into nearby foes, dealing electric damage to anyone they contact. Powerful fulgars can also call down lightning. 

### Sagaars 

Sagaars are strong martial artists who rely on strange dancing motions to combat enemies. They are limber and lithe and difficult to catch. They are most closely related to a monk, though some rogue sublasses are comparable to sagaars as well. 

Sagaars are often dancers first and foremost, and prefer elegant steps to fighting in combat. 

## Universal Subclasses

This adventure also introduces the concept of universal subclasses, subclasses with features that can be applied to any character. Often, the acquisition of a new subclass requires time and training to achieve, and characters may find the expense or difficulty of acquiring new subclasses a limit on how many they adopt. If you worry that your players will try to adopt too many of these classes, you may impose a hard limit of 1 per character. 

### Leer

A Leer is a person who uses special potives on their eyes and other sense organs to improve their perception. There are two varieties: Falsepeople, who can detect lies, and Laggards, who can sense things that others cannot. 

The washes can be expensive to obtain and cause permanent alteration to eye color. Characters who elect to undergo the procedure may also acquire specialized equipment to aid in their skills.

# About the Adventure
Designed for characters from the first level to the 5th level, The Humorous Journey begins on the Vinegar Seas aboard a vessel of war and ends in the city of Boschenberg after the revelation of a terrible secret. DMs can use this quest as a standalone adventure or an introduction to the world of the Half-Continent and new adventures that lie beyond. 

## Adventure Overview
When a peer by the name of Penescus Linth enlists a group of Brandenard naval ships to guard a precious treasure aboard a cargo on its crossing over the Grume and up the river Humour, characters are aboard one of the ships, the *Melinde Hammer*. After being openly attacked by imperial ships on the Grume, characters awaken with the cargo, a Wit named Madam Zarine. Zarine is on a dangerous mission: to ascertain whether a member of the peerage in Boschenberg is entering into the dark trades. 

Meanwhile, a conniving merchant named Goethense Deranque is scouring the coast for the Brandenard treasure, keenly aware that it is a wit destined for the city of Boschenberg, and the daughter of a powerful Brandenard lord. In league with the shadowy earl Bruschentës of Boschenberg, Goethense wishes to stop the young woman from reaching her destination, and will use all the tools of the dark trades to stop the adventurers from reaching their destination. 

Ending in the city of Boschenberg, adventurers who elect to expose the dark earl and side with the wit have the gratitude and reward from the Dukes of Boschenberg for rooting out a terrible wickedness in their city. Alternatively, characters may choose to side with the dark traders, extending their own power through illegitimate means. 

### Battles on the High-Seas

The story begins just moments before a massive naval battle between the *Melinde Hammer* and an opposing ship, the *Piltherd*, begins. As the cargo accompaniment is three ships, and the opponent three as well, characters will have time to organize with one another before the battle commences. 

After the good Captain Schaleinder is killed by a high-fired cannon, characters have the ability to take control of the ship and operate it in open battle against the Piltherd. Both ships are already damaged but characters may be able to sink their opponent and bring the ship to landfall. 

During this phase, characters can cooperate with the navy officers and attempt to make landfall as close to civilization as possible. Characters that survive the battle with the *Piltherd* will also encounter a small swarm of dangerous nadderers as they near the beach. 

### Touching down in the Brindleshaws

Characters either land an inoperable ram, or wake up upon, the shores of the Brindleshaws depending on the wake of the battle. On the marshy shores, characters will have to search and investigate the many  ruins of destroyed ships that have washed up here. 

Characters might discover whispers in the ruins of the *Piltherd* depending on whether or not the ship was destroyed. If they do, they will learn the fleet belonged to the merchant Goethense Deranque. They will learn of his involvement with the dark trades and that he wishes to obtain the "treasure" aboard the travelling cargo.

Characters navigating this area will also come across battles between the remaining sailors and a series of bog-trotters in Deranque's employ. During a particularly dangerous fight with a pair of raging Gudgeons (man-made monsters) they meet with the wit Zarine and can join forces against the enemy bandits. 

Characters must now escape the Brindleshaws, and quickly, as they must deal with growing threwd and threats of monster attacks. Depending on the course they chart, they may head for High Vesting to the east, the Harefoot Dig to the north, or the River Humour to the west. Zarine understands her position is dangerous and will stay with the characters. However, she also offers to lead the party to an imperial fort she's heard of in the wilds, called the Arxis Sublicum, or Pollberg, in the midst of the swamp. She doesn't know it has fallen.

Characters must choose quickly though; each night spent in the wilds will see a new monster attack. One night minimum must be spent in the wilds of the Sough before characters are able to clear out of the area. 

#### Going to High Vesting
The road to high vesting allows characters to find the vestiweg road after a night in the fens and go south toward the city. If characters choose this road, they will be harried by a group of fearsome highway robbers called the Gundermen. Passers by in carriages can aid the travellers. As dungeon master, you will be able to choose which travellers the characters meet on the road to High Vesting. 

Once in the city, characters can meet and deal with a begrudging merchant for passage aboard his barge, the *Spandergunn.* The merchant, Zandierus Gunn, is hoping to transport black market potives without visibility at the rivergates. In exchange for helping his crew smuggle the goods through the gates, he will grant the characters free passage. 

High Vesting also offers the first opportunity for downtime. Characters can elect to spend months in the city, practicing trades or learning skills, or making money on already-learned skills. If this is the case, Madam Zarine will acquiesce by agreeing that some time spent gathering information could help her accomplish her task. 

#### Going to the Harefoot Dig

The Harefoot Dig wayhouse is possibly the simplest. Also a day's journey north through the Brindleshaws, characters can arrive at the Dig to warm wayfood, interesting company, and a strange rumor of darkness on the road. 

\page

The characters may at this point discover rumors that a lord in Boschenberg has individuals staying at the inn. These individuals take Madam Zarine's attention immediately. If left unchecked, she will discover that they are servants of the dark trade, with a dangerous skold at their help named Lynesse. 

If the characters defeat and interrogate a member of this company, they will discover that a ship in the dark trades, the *Spandergunn,* is laid up to the North at Proud Sulking. Characters may have to sneak or connive their way onto the ship in this scenario. 

#### Going through the Bogs

If characters listen to Madam Zerine, they may elect to go toward Pollberg. When they arrive, they will find that a large Bogle called the Pelterman Wretch has levelled the citadel and is using it as a home for itself. 

After dealing with the wretch (undetected characters do not necessarily need to engage in combat), characters will spend an additional night in the swamp. In this plotline, a human-sized nuglung will visit their camp. It is neutral toward the characters and they may engage in coversation with it, though Madam Zerine will protest. It will claim its title is Sir Heron and that it saw them fighting gudgeons on the beach and so counts them as allies. 

Characters that take this path thus have their first encounter with a monster that is not necessarily hostile, though the lady Zerine (and each of the characters, for that matter) will understand the steep price that comes with sedonition (monster-loving). 

On the third day, they arrive on the river Humour and manage to hail a passing cromster called the *Spandergunn*. In this scenario, characters will not know that the ship is carrying illegal goods, and the Captain Trindbrawl is more than happy to threaten them if they don't comply. 

## A Riverjourney
Characters are, at this point, aboard the Spandergunn and headed north at a decent clip. They may be injured after fighting, or exhausted by threwd, and so the first few days aboard the ship may be spent exclusively on rest. 

Characters who are curious can investigate the ship's operation or help with daily activities. However, they will slowly gather that the ship is engaged in illicit activities, if they did not know so before boarding. 

Characters may choose to ally with or fight against the captain of the ship. A fight is particularly difficult, as the wit Madam Zerine is now days off her daily draft and is beginning to spasm (if a character in the group is a wit with the ability to brew the required draft, this might not be the case). Battling the captain is particularly difficult, as his crew is loyal and will take up arms as well. 

Characters may also choose to keep Zarine's, and their own, identities a secret. If they do not, Captain Trindbrawl will balance his ability to combat the group with the opportunity to sell them out to Lord Bruschentës, who he also does business with. 

Characters and the captain may also elect for a middle ground, or if they went to High Vesting will have agreed, to help the captain by transporting goods overland at the Spindle and rejoining the ship afterwards to avoid the authorities. 

> Some characters might prefer not to associate with the dark trades at all, either in High Vesting, or along the Vestiweg, or on the river. If characters understand that the Spandergunn is a ship in the dark trades and do not wish to associate with it, they may charter another barge. As DM, you can elect to come up with a barge and a captain if you so choose, or you can take up one of the examples: <div class='descriptive'>
The river vessel *Roosterneck* is carrying grain from High Vesting to Proud Sulking before carrying on to Boschenberg. Their captain, Hilenet Faloquin, is more than happy to ferry your group north.
</div><div class='descriptive'>
The *Laurieline* is bringing a group of noble merchants north to Boschenberg, but they need protection. If the party has proven their prowess against monsters, they might be the right people for the job.
</div><div class='descriptive'>
The *Uberschwinden * is bound for Gightland, and will carry passengers to Boschenberg... but not for free.
</div> If the party elects to make the journey on a different vessel that the *Spandergunn*, the other ship will pursue them, as Captain Trindbrawl has learned that an expensive target is aboard the ship.

If Trindbrawl surrenders to the characters, he will tell them what he knows (though it is little) about the lord Bruschentës, notably that the lord is trading in the dark trades, and that the cargo of the *Melinde Hammer* caravan was important to him. Rumor was spreading that the cargo was a wit with some power who could be turned over to the Dukes of Boschenberg for decent prize-money. While this is true, it is also true that the Dukes do not know of Bruschentës's illegal activities.

Trindbrawl is ignorant of the Lord's actual activities, however, and is not servicable as a mole - just an opportunist. Characters can elect to turn he and his ship in at a rivergate, or negotiate the remainder of the passage and continue to aid in his transportation needs.

Journeying north, the characters might encounter rivergoing monsters, dangerous smugglers, or encounters with revenue officers on their way to Boschenberg, depending on their choices so far.

#### Stopping in Proud Sulking
Characters who are injured, tired, or otherwise in need of a break may spend downtime in Proud Sulking if they so choose. See *Spending Downtime* for more information.

\page 

## Welcome to Boschenberg

After passing the Spindle and the Axles into the city of Boschenberg, the characters are confronted by a massive metropolis with a bustling trade population. They may elect to spend downtime at this point engaged in any number of activities. If they do so, Madam Zerline will stay in contact with them as she looks for information about the individuals in the city who might get her access to her mark. 

Eventually, Zarine will gather that there is a salon in one of the nicer precincts in town called Gaudenart's Pententium, where nobles gather to discuss business, politics, and (she believes) their involvement with a man who proves to be the Elephantine Bruschentës. 

Characters may now attempt to get to Bruschentës himself, or negotiate their way into the dark trades by double-crossing the Brandenard wit. 

### Going to the Salon

Characters can visit the Pententium and gather intelligence on local leads. They must exercise some tact to get anyone in the salon to speak with them, and the rules about what is permitted and what is not are quite strict.

Characters who ask directly about Bruschentës activities are likely to be reported to the city's soldiers, or may be turned over to Bruschentës's operatives directly. Below are some of the people that characters may attempt to interrogate, although as Dungeon master you may introduce more as you see fit. 

#### Halderd Swampenhaur

Halderd is a loud-talking, brazen pamphleteer whose presence is only permitted in the salon by virtue of his aptitude for telling particularly salacious rumors. Halderd has heard many things about the duke Bruschentës, but any character that speaks to him risks having their secrets told in turn. 

#### Audena Corvinius Arbour 
Audena, the proud daughter of *the* Corvinus Arbour family in Boschenberg, is a budding teratologist and a knack for manipulating pistols. She has heard rumors that the Bruschentës family, a mercantile rival of her own (if not a social rival) family's, deals in black trades by the docks. She will gladly accompany the characters to the docks, particularly if there's gudgeons to kill. 

#### Gaudenart

Gaudenart is the owner and proprieter of the penitentium. A man with a fondness for high society, he is nonetheless aware (as he is not, himself, a member of it) that the best way to gain access to information is not through the peerage and will steer the characters toward interviewing people at the Bruschentës high house itself.


### The High House

All paths point to the Bruschentës secret being locked away in the high house owned by the family, and characters can access it by intrusion, having a contact on the inside, manipulation, or another means. 

Once inside, they will have to navigate the fine rooms and hallways of the home, searching for anything that might indicate what is happening. Characters who have received some intelligence from reputable sources are aware of secret doors established within the house itself. 

Eventually, characters reveal a hidden porthole that leads into a vast underground basement, where the secret is finally revealed: By importing illegal organs and potives, Lord Bruschentës has established an illegal surgery to manufacture lahzars for cheap within the empire, for sale to work in the dark trades and make the criminals of the world all the more dangerous. 

If characters have been careful, they may navigate the basement freely until detection. If they have not, and have made their presence and intention in the city known, Bruschentës will be awaiting them and the dungeon will be filled with poorly-made and poorly-trained criminal lahzars. Even these are dangerous enemies. 

## The Final Fight 

In his chamber beneath the house, characters will find the great Elephantine Vignantius Bruschentës and his two children, Railline and Vigour, who have respectively been transmogrified into a wit and a fulgar, and who have more power (though still lack training) than their cohort. Bruschentës, hedging his bet, also has a caged Gudgeon called the Frenetic Clight locked away to be released if the battle goes ill. 

Bruschentës himself is an able scourge when needs be, but will not deploy his art unless it seems his children are faltering. As a last resort, he releases the ravenous gudgeon and begins administering devastating potives, though at the risk that the uncontrollable beast will turn on he and his children. 

## Epilogue

Should the characters best Bruschentës and expose the ring, they can bring the evidence of the criminal enterprise to the Dukes of Boschenberg for an exorbitant amount of renown and prize-money. The surgeon in Lord Bruschentës employ, Commus Phender, will attempt to convince the characters to leave the profitable enterprise open and take control. 

Madam Zarine, if she has survived, will reveal herself as the daughter of Penescus Linth and offer the characters additional reward if they present their findings to the Dukes of Boschenberg and help her leave the city undetected. 

### Future Stories

From here, characters will choose to settle in Boschenberg for a time, or continue their exploits across the Half-Continent. While the story in this book is designed to be self-contained, future story hooks can be provided for additonal adventures in the future. 

#### Goethense Deranque 
Goethense Deranque is still at large, his motives sinister and his capabilities unknown. Tracking him down is the perfect task for parties interested in combating the dark trades in the Half-Continent... or pursuing them.

\page

#### The Fall of Pollberg
The Empire's fortress in the Brindleshaws has fallen into the hands of monsters. How did this happen? For characters interested in learning more about the war between humans and monsters, this plot hook could lead into adventures deep in wild lands.

#### Brandenard Espionage
Madam Zarine is going home, but she is impressed with the character's exploits on the road. Parties interested in statecraft or politics might go with Zarine to Brandenbrass, where tensions between the states are always boiling.

#### The Gightlands
Leading into the adventure *The Gightland Queen,* the adventurers have earned a good reputation with the D<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
ukes of Boschenberg, and perhaps a reputation as able teratologists themselves. Word has spread that the Gightlands of Catalain are under attack from monsters in unprecendented forces, and a river expedition is being organized to go north to aid the Gightlanders. For characters interested in difficult combat and exploring the open world, this is the ideal adventure. 

### Worlds Beyond 
Characters should be level 5 when this adventure comes to a close, and have encountered many dangers in their travels. Characters can choose to spend long downtimes - even years - training and honing new skills. A character may decide to train as a skald, or may travel to sinster for transmogrification. Voyages to new lands in the Half-Continent are always adventures to be told - get creative and see where the world takes your party. Perhaps they'll stand before the gates of Clementine itself.

# Chapter I: Turmoil on the Vinegar Seas
Brandenbrass: A bustling port city on the Vinegar Seas, popping with activity in every wharf and on every quay. The city walls are guarded day and night by watchful armies, and in the port harbor ships belonging to the world's largest navy come and go, never idling long before heading out to tread over the waves toward new fortunes yet again. 

Brandenbrass is the most powerful City-State in the Soutlands, by most reckonings. Though it possesses very little land, its naval power is formidable and its economic power vast. Across the great bay called the Grume and up the river Humour, Brandenbrass's massive rivergate - the Spindle - funnels money from trade to the capital city, to the chagrin of their rival state, Boschenberg. 

Brandenbrass is home to high-falutin mercenary companies and powerful banks, and the proliferation of mercantilism has seen the city, with its powerful ram-building operations, come into extreme wealth and power. The people here serve on rams, own rams, build rams, and manage rams.

## Tension in the Soutlands
Brandenbrass, despite its power, rivals other city-states in an everpresent but never-settled contest of power. Chief among these rivals is the inland Boschenberg. Of late, hostilities between the cities are rising even higher, though no military might has yet been brought to bear. 

That being said, economic warfare is both open and common, and there's a fortune to be had for folk in either city with services to sell. As such, hoardes of adventurers, vinegaroons, and merchants assemble by the seashores each morning to find compelling work aboard one of the oceangoing vessels. 

## Running this Chapter

Characters begin this chapter at the first level. They meet with the Captain of their ram and representative of their employer. As they disembark aboard the ship *Melindë's Hammer* under the Captain Schaleinder, they meet a small group of nadderers attracted by the ship's activity. Though not much of a threat, the characters will earn renown and a second level if they defeat the creatures.

The characters will then be involved in a large naval battle between their own flotilla and a group of enemy ships. If characters survive, they advance to the third level.

## Disembarcation in Brandenbrass
At the behest of the Lord Penescus Linth, characters have been hired to accompany a flotilla escorting a cargo ship called the *Bethella* across the Grume to High Vesting. Characters have several ways of receiving this order, depending on their background. A character in the Brandenard Navy, for example, might already be serving under Captain Schaleinder aboard the *Melindë Hammer*. Other characters might be new recruits. Some, who have a background as a peer, perhaps, may be chartering passage with the flotilla. However, most characters will likely be young, inexperienced teratologists hoping to make a name for themselves. Consult the table below for roleplaying these character motives. 
##### Payment for Work
| Occupation | Amount (Sous) |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Vinegaroon  | 0.5 - 1 |
| Teratologist  | 10 |
| Dispensurist | 2 |
A character not serving aboard the ship will have to pay for passage - only a single sou for the expense.
### Reaching the Docks
Have each character describe briefly how their life has led them to Brandenbrass. They will begin their morning in the city and start off on the long journey to the docks, either on foot or by carriage. The docks are not in the city center and require a journey north, beyond the walls of old Brandentown, through suburbs and peaceful countryside toward a series of long jetties called the Hale Birth. Characters who are reticent to set up can be located easily by naval agents under Lord Linth's direction. Particularly if the character is to serve aboard the vessel, they have a contract that is written already and naval agents can be very pushy.

Upon reaching the dock, the character will be introduced. Those wishing to serve in the crew, or as new recruits, are ushered directly into work. Those with passage are not required to socialize but are asked to wait dockside while the ship is loaded. Those serving as teratologists on the expedition are introduced to one another. 
### Introducing Captain Schaleinder

Captain Arnalaus Schaleinder is a **captain**, with these changes: 
- Schaleinder has a wisdom of 15
- He has a deception skill of 17

Arn has served years in the Brandenard navy aboard his ship. It was a long climb to the top, and despite not yearning for what awaits him in retirement, the good captain is getting older.

Jovial but plain, Schaleinder has all the hallmarks of a long-serving **vinegaroon** - deep pock-marks from the vinegar seas, dry straw white hair, and worn-out, non-decorated clothing. Unlike some captains aboard these vessels, Schaleinder prefers to wear what his crew wears and does not believe that wearing uniforms that make him stand out  as captain makes any strategic sense. 

Schaleinder is keenly aware of the dangers that face this passage, and knows that his "cargo" is the wit Madam Zarine, the daughter of his employer, Lord Penescus Linth. Despite having some distrust for lahzars, as all everypeople do, Schaleinder has forged a long career from taking contracts from Lord Linth and, though he is getting suitably paid for this journey, considers it a favor in part to the lord. He will not divulge the contents of the the cargo *Bethella* and a character must beat a contested insight/deception check to even ascertain that Schaleinder knows its contents. 

Schaleinder will openly greet any teratologist serving on the vessel and let them know that there's a chance of violence on the searoute, though nothing terrible. The Lord Linth has hired younger, cheaper teratologists for this reason. Schaleinder will also introduce himself to new crew people. If someone decides to take a background of service in the navy, it is possible that they already have a relationship with Schaleinder. 

When all characters have assembled, Schaleinder will give the order and disembark into the black waters of the Grume. 

## The Open Sea
Once out on the open waters, characters can have some leeway to explore the ship. The *Melindë Hammer* is a large main-ram of some notoriety in battles. Characters who speak to the Captain or one of the crewspeople may be pointed toward the ship's **dispensurist** Ignates Lorn. Lorn is an ancient, grizzled vinegaroon with intense knowledge about the ship. He can tell the characters that the ship served at the Battle of the Mole and has been key in several fights against large **kraulschwimmen.**

The *Hammer* is nearly 900 feet long with four masts, resembling the two other ships in the flotilla escorting the *Bethella*. It has two gun decks with 76 cannons on each side. The lower decks are dedicated to the gastrines and some crew quarters, despite the smell. There is a deck aboard the ram dedicated to sleeping quarters for anyone not working the gastrines. 

Characters serving aboard the ship may be vinegaroons serving above-deck or gastrineers serving beneath. These characters will have to see to their duties and follow the marine schedule of bells. They will not have much free time. Characters who are teratologists or passengers, however, will not have much to do but explore the ship or speak with crewspeople. 

### Crew of the *Hammer*
If the characters are looking for work, or something to do, aboard the ship, they can consult with several crewspeople aboard. 
\page
#### Ignates Lorn 
Ignates, a grumpy old dispensurist, is well-versed in the history of the vessel. He will tell characters what he knows about the vessel's lifespan. An insight check of DC 12 or higher reveals that, while mostly correct, time and the telling have blown some of the stories of kraulschwimmen out of proportion. 

Characters can help Ignates distribute alembic drafts among certain crewmen to protect their skin. A character can make a DC 10 medicine check to determine their success at identifying those in need of the draft. Doing so successfully earns them Lorn's respect, and some goodwill among those serving aboard the vessel. Failing results in a bolstered reputation among the crew of the *Hammer* as a lubber. 

#### Seranë Lunemoor 
Seranë Lunemoor is a laggard leer and first mate of the *Hammer.* Her eyes are the typical laggards, with olive brown eye whites and yellow pupils. She uses a sthenicon with some frequency to scan the horizon. Though the crew regards her as odd, she and Captain Schaleinder have seen a great deal together and will not be separated. 

Lunemoor makes for an odd conversation partner as she's more soft-spoken than the typical vinegaroon. She is a **laggard** and can often tell more about people than they expect. As she's grown older, however, the salt seas are wearing away her senses and she expects her time aboard a navy vessel is coming to a close.

Lunemoor is, in spite of her soft-spokenness, a canny and able commander. She does not appreciate idleness or ineffectiveness. A character not engaging in their duties will earn her disapproval - as will a passenger actively in the way of crew business. Characters who are dutiful will earn her approval. This includes teratologist characters, who Lunemoor expects to be on watch on the upper deck in the event of an attack.

#### Aesling Kreider
Aesling Kreider is the chief gastrineer aboard the *Hammer*. She does not appreciate people who come to the gastrines without need or cause. Like all gastrineers, she is superstitious about the operation of each gastrine and can be persuaded to speak to someone who asks the right questions. 

A person speaking with Aesling must make a DC 15 persuasion check to convince her to converse at all, and even then, she will be icy. However, if the person leads by asking about the gastrines, the DC becomes 14 and Aesling will not be rude. 

Aesling believes that no. 3 (Sheila) is nervous around newcomers and doesn't perform as well if it hears unrecognized voices. She will offer other strange opinions about the other gastrines if asked. Aesling is a **vinegaroon** with the following changes: 

1. Perception +4 
2. Nature +4
3. Medicine +5

Aesling might ask a character who she begins to trust help her prime one of the limbers by cranking it as one of her gastrineer's mates is not well that morning. The player must make a DC 10 sleight-of-hand check to successfully crank the limber to her satisfaction; if they succeed, Aesling and the gastrineers will be friendlier. If they fail, they might damage the limber and Aesling will not speak to them again, asking them only to leave.

<div style='margin-top:10px'></div>

Characters who engage with the crew of the *Hammer* either help or hurt their reputation with the crew. Some characters may choose to ask around about the contents of the *Bethella*. Vinegaroons are a superstitious group by nature, and many will become agitated if the questions are not posed carefully. Most have served under their captain for years and are not concerned about the safety of the mission.

If a character asks too frequently, Lunemoor will eventually intercede and ask the character to stop. 

<div style="margin-top:10px"></div>

> ##### Discipline on a Vessel
><div style=""></div>
> The *Hammer* is a naval vessel that follows a strict code of behavior. Characters who do not respect this code will be reminded by a commander - most often Lunemoor or Schaleinder - that this is a military vessel and everyone aboard must observe good conduct while the ship treads. Multiple offenses will be grounds for more serious intervention. A character who does not comply will face several dozen potential Vinegaroon enemies, and a night in the brig, as punishment for their behavior.

<div style="margin-top:10px"></div>
### locations aboard the *Hammer*
The following are keyed to locations identified in map 1.1
#### H1 The Weather Deck
The highest deck on the *Hammer*, the weather deck is where characters will often see First Mate Lunemoor or Captain Schaleinder at work. It is also often house for teratologists and other non-crew workers who need to operate in a place with full view of the ship. It is often not very crowded. 

#### H2 The Mate's Quarters
This is **Seranë Lunemoor's** private quarters and office. The door is kept locked during the day. Picking the lock requires a successful DC 15 sleight-of-hand check and a lockpick. A character can also make a DC 15 strength check to kick it in, though they will be heard by the guards at the Captain's Quarters (H3). Seranë keeps the key on her person and it requires a DC 25 sleight of hand check to lift it from her without her noticing - made at disadvantage if the character does not know where on her person she keeps it. 

Within is not much; Seranë's hammock, spare harness, spare weapons, some provisions, some drink, some potives with alembic properties, and some bothersalts.

A character who fails a DC 15 sleight of hand check will leave evidence of their presence, and Lunemoor will guess that someone has entered her room.
\page
#### H3 The Captain's Quarters 
This is Captain Schaleinder's personal quarters. It is guarded at all times by two **vinegaroons** who exchange the duty with another pair on the bells system - watches of four hours apiece. Characters cannot approach the door without being sighted by the guards. 

Characters seeking to gain entry may persuade the guards (DC 20) or intimidate them (DC 20), but these are old salts who are loyal to their captain and difficult to move. Failing these checks will result in being reported to Schaleinder. Characters may also fight them, although they will have to be careful as the guards will attempt to raise alarms, and the fighting will most likely be heard. If the fight was quiet, have the party make a collective DC 15 stealth check. If the fight was loud, they will be heard regardless. 

Within the captain's quarters is his hammock, desk, 4000 sous worth of prize-money, spare harness (including a +1 jackcoat), and papers detailing the "cargo" aboard the *Bethella.* These papers reveal that the precious cargo is a person who is mutually known to the captain and Lord Linth, but they provide no further details in writing about the individual. Other papers in his correspondences indicate that there's a reasonable chance the caravan will be attacked by pirates of some variety. 

Characters must make a DC 13 sleight of hand check when searching the captain's effects; if they fail, he will know someone entered his quarters. 

#### H4 The Quarterbeam 
This is where most passengers ride aboard a naval vessel, although rams like this only rarely carry passengers. 

#### H5 Passenger Rooms and Cargo
Rams like the *Hammer* are not passenger ships or cargo ships, but the *Hammer* is unique in its possession of some passenger rooms and some cargo holds. Each room is tremendously spartan, however, with a simple hammock and a small area to stow one's possessions. The latrines are found at the rear of the quarterbeam. 

#### H6 The Pinch Deck 
Hundreds of **vinegaroons** bustle around this busy deck, engaged in the business of treading on the vinegar seas, including the near-constant task of cleaning the salt spray from the deck to avoid from corroding the wood. While a vinegaroon is right at home here, a passenger would be considered a lubber and very much in the way. Teratologists, on the other hand, would not be welcome, though no vinegaroon will have anything to say about their presence on that deck.

#### H7 Crew Quarters
The crew quarters are packed full of hammocks where all of the crew, apart from the mates and the captain, sleep. It is a foul-smelling place in the middle of the day... more so at night.

#### H8 Crew Mess
The crew mess consists of long tables with benches on either side where the crew takes meals, though it is mostly used only for serving. The cook, an old vinegaroon called Bumstew, earned his nickname from the flavor of soups he makes aboard the ram. 

He and his kitchen staff (who are all vinegaroons as well, not servants) are always looking for an extra hand, and a character with some skill in cooking will be welcome to help as long as they keep their opinions to themself.

#### H9 The First Gun Deck
The first gun deck, or the higher of the two, is dedicated solely to firing the 19 cannons on either side. While some vinegaroons are in here fussing constantly over the nick and trim of the guns, and ensuring that the cannonballs are arranged and the powder properly tended, there is almost never anyone here unless the ship is in open battle.

#### H10 The Second Gun Deck
Same as the first gun deck, but a floor lower.


#### H11 The Gastrines
The gastrines are below water and are marked by the long array of boxes - 12 in total - each called a gastrine. Each gastrine contains a muscle in it that turns a shaft which in turn rotates the propellers, or "screws." This is the ship's engine, and is overseen by a respectable but throroughly odd crew of gastrineers headed up by Aesling Kreider.

Most people do not have any business being in the gastrines. Even above-deck vinegaroons rarely venture down. However, most gastrineers never need to worry about this, because the smell on the deck alone repels most people. 

#### H12 The Orlop

The lowest deck of the ship. Some of the gastrineers sleep down here, though most prefer to sleep with the gastrines. 

#### H13 The Brig
A collection of cells housing the ship's unruly lot. They are, presently, empty - unless a character has done something deserving of stowage, in which case they are sent here along with two armed **vinegaroon** guards. 

### Passing Time aboard the *Hammer*

Several days will pass aboard the *Hammer* before any action commences. Characters can explore the ship and try to get a good reputation among the crew. They may also suspect their mission and the Captain, though access to the captain's logs is difficult to manage for character's of the 1st level.

A main-ram like the *Hammer* can travel at a maximum of 11 knots, so travel is slow. It will take 10 days total for the voyage to reach port. DMs should use the first three days to allow characters to establish themselves, meet one another, and get used to their roleplaying style.

### Attack of the Snagtooth Weirdings

On each day of the journey, characters may make perception checks (with advantage if the character is a teratologist who has been on watch) to determine if the ship is in any danger. On the third day, a successful check will reveal to a character either the sight, smell, or sound of an approaching danger. A character who chooses to rely on smell will know it as the smell of a monster. 

Characters may notify Captain Schaleinder, who will quickly rouse the crew into action. First Mate Lunemoor will organize sailors on the gun decks. 
\page
Any character who beats a DC 10 Nature check knows that the monsters are too small to effectively fight the creatures that are coming, and knows that the crew's best defense is to close the cannon holes and take to the pinch deck (*H6*). Either Lunemoor or Schaleinder will heed this warning if a character makes the case to them.

The monsters in question are called **snagtooth weirdings**. Their attack is opportunistic at first. As they reach the upper decks, they will catch scent of the Rever-Finger stashed in Captain Schaleinder's quarters (he has been given it as proof of the legitimacy of his mission) and enter an open rage. If they do 
#### First Round
In the first round of combat, 7 small **snagtooth weirdings** begin to make their way up the side of the ship, using tentacle-like suction hooks to climb. Lunemoor, if she is on the pinch deck, will offer shipspikes to those assembled there. Characters can use ship spikes on the upper deck to pry the weirdings off the side with a DC 10 athletics check; this does not damage the creature but does delay it. 

If the cannon portholes are open, the weirdings will board the lower gundeck (*H10*) and do battle with the **vinegaroons** there. If the portholes are closed, it will take another turn for the weirdings to reach the second gundeck. 

Characters with ranged abilities may use their abilities down the side of the deck. If they choose to do so, they will attack with advantage. 
#### Second Round
If the weirdings reach the second round, they will cross into the pinch deck and attack any character they can reach. Their initial assault is levied at random and they do not coordinate strategically at all. 

#### Third Round
A second batch of 7 **snagtooth weirdings** start their ascent toward a deck they can enter. If any weirdings from the first batch were knocked loose and are still climbing, they will communicate with their immediate allies. Attacks against them will be made without advantage, and shipspikes require a DC 13 athletics check to succeed. 

The weirdings fighting on the deck will start using **pair fighting** unless they cannot get to a nearby ally. Weirdings fighting like this are significantly more dangerous. They will, given the chance to move without too much risk from opportunity attacks, draw a route to the upper decks of the ship. 

#### Fourth Round 
Weirdings will continue to try to assault the upper decks of the ship. At this stage, Lunemoor will try to order a coordinated push against the creatures, regardless of which deck she is on. Characters in the line of fire will have to move behind the line. If they choose to remain before it, they have two options:
1. Make a DC 10 Acrobatics check to climb a mast or drop over the side of the ram (lying down on the deck will not protect them) 
2. Make a DC 15 acrobatics check to avoid potive attacks and get to safety. 

If the character fails either of these checks, they will take (tbd) damage from the potives launched by Lunemoor - but so will any weirdings within the area of effect. 

If the weirdings reach the upper decks, they will cease their attacks on any sailors and try viciously to breach the door to the Captain's Quarters. At this point, the weirdings have entered a **wild fury** but will only levy it against characters who use melee attacks against them. 

#### Later Rounds 
If weirdings still survive Lunemoor's barrage and the characters' fighting, they will do one of two things: 
1. Any that reach the upper decks will keep attacking the Captain's quarters. The creatures are no longer hostile to the characters, and you may accelerate their slaughter by simply narrating Lunemoor and the characters finishing the last of them off. 
2. Any weirdings on the pinch deck, gun decks, or scaling the strakes will flee back into the sea. 

### Aftermath

Characters will have the thanks and respect of the crew, though a number of sailors will have been killed depending on how the battle progressed. 

Sailors might insist on bottling the ichor of several of the creatures for the characters to receive cruorpunxes. Any character may take a vial of ichor, though only those who choose the road to High Vesting will have the opportunity to use this ichor for a tattoo before it spoils. It introduces them to the notion of receiving the tattoo; they will have other opportunities later.

Characters will suspect the captain's quarters of having something strange, provided the weirdings reached the upper decks. If they do suspect the captain, he will not say anything immediately as he is focused on cleaning up after the encounter. If pushed, he will maintain that such incidents, while uncommon on this part of the Grume, are always a possibility. He will also claim that he has some powerful, attracting potives in his store that he suspects have come open by mistake. A character who makes a successful DC 12 insight check will know he is lying. Insinuating this to him will prompt a threat. Continuing will prompt an arrest.

If the characters survive this threat, they will advance to the seond level.

## The Captain's Secret

More days pass aboard the ship as several of the **vinegaroons** and characters are probably recovering from injuries. In the meantime, word has risen among the crew that the expedition may be in some danger. Characters might interrogate the friend's they've made aboard, investigate themselves, or dismiss the danger. 

### The Crews Verdict

The **vinegaroons** aboard will generally believe that the expedition is in some danger. An attack of such a scale on these calm, well-trafficked waters is deeply unsettling to them. These vinegaroons are frank about their feelings with one exception: They will balk at speaking ill of Schaleinder. 

\page
A DC 10 Insight check will reveal from any one of them that they are secretly quite bothered by the attack. If the weirdings reached the Captain's quarters, the crew will be somewhat suspicious of why this happened. A fastidious captain is not liable to let dangerous nullodours leak, and they worry that their captain's state of mind is not ideal. 

##### Ignates Lorn
Lorn will know a lot about the monsters themselves and some about their habits (see **snagtooth weirding** for monster information). He is, however, a level-headed old salt and won't attribute the attack to anything more sinister than an unhappy coincidence.

##### Seranë Lunemoor

Asking Lunemoor is a dangerous and a tactful business. Any character who broaches the topic must be careful not to implicate the captain in the events of the day. If they do, they must succeed a DC 14 persuasion check to prevent Lunemoor from arresting them immediately. If they succeed, Lunemoor will not discuss the topic further.

If a character is careful, Lunemoor will divulge that she knows the captain is more personally attached to this mission than usual, but that she trusts him and does not believe he would willfully endanger the crew. 

##### Aesling Kreider

Gastrineer Kreider requires only a DC 10 persuasion check to speak. 

In Kreider's opinion, the attack was very bizarre. In all her years of service, monsters have targeted the gastrines above all else. The nutrient paste she uses to feed the engines is 10x more attractive than all but the nicest nullodors. She figures that the captain must have something strange indeed in his quarters to draw the weirdings away from the gastrines.

Kreider will not know much about the rumors floating around on the above deck. Her gastrineers are above listening to such pap. She's sailed with her captain for 16 years and does not suspect him of anything wrong. 

### Investigating the Ship

Character's speaking with the crew will be unlikely to succeed in fomenting general distrust against the captain. If they decide to openly confront him, they must make a contested persuasion check - the collective check of the characters who participate against the collective check of Captain Schaleinder, Aesling Kreider, and Seranë Lunemoor. If they fail, it's the brig. 

Characters may also try to get into the Captain's quarters. If they have not advertised their mistrust of the captain, there will be no guards posted at the doors on the upper deck anymore (injuries from the battle have required som reassignments, and Schaleinder wants to allay suspicion). A DC 12 Sleight-of-Hand check will get the door open now, as it was heavily damaged during the fight. 

Characters within the room will have to make a DC 15 perception check to locate the source of the smell. They might not detect it at all unless their class allows them to do so more easily (that is, if they are a **laggard**). Characters can make this check multiple times, but after five checks they will be discovered by the Captain himself.
